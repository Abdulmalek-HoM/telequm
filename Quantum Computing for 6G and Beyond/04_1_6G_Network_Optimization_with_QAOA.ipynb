We will model a common telecom challenge—**frequency channel assignment**—as a graph problem and use the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to find an optimal solution."

    "### **1. The Telecom Problem: Minimizing Interference in 6G**\n",
    "\n",
    "In any wireless network, from 4G to 6G, a critical task is assigning communication channels (frequencies) to cell towers or user devices. If two nearby towers use the same channel, they can interfere with each other, degrading signal quality and network performance. The goal is to create an assignment that minimizes this interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model this problem using a graph:\n",
    "* **Nodes** represent the cell towers.\n",
    "* **Edges** connect towers that are close enough to interfere with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to partition the nodes into two groups (representing two different frequency channels, let's call them Channel A and Channel B) in a way that the number of edges connecting nodes *within the same group* is minimized. This is equivalent to maximizing the number of edges connecting nodes *between different groups*. This classic graph problem is known as **Max-Cut**."
